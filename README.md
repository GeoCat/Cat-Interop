##OSGeo Working Group on Catalogue Interoperability
A place to version documents and discuss issues surrounding the Cat-Interop Project
http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Cat-Interop.

###Issues:

* __ServiceTypes in CSW responses__: Currently geoportal, geonetwork and other CSW service providers represent ServiceTypes in many different ways, making machine-to-machine search and access difficult.  It would be great if we could standardize on an approach. A [strawman approach is here](https://github.com/OSGeo/Cat-Interop/blob/master/ServiceTypes.md). Please [provide feedback and join the discussion](https://github.com/OSGeo/Cat-Interop/issues/1).
